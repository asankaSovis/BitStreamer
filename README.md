BitStreamer is a data streaming software developed for communication engineers to send a bit stream from one COM port and check how many bits can be recieved back from another COM port. Here, the bitstream from the first COM port can be sent through a communication medium to check the efficiency of communication medium.

> Bidirectional mode

## Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Go to `Options > Directional Mode` and choose `Bidirectional Mode` if needed.
3. Under `Transmitter`, choose the transmitting COM port and baud rate and click `Connect`.
4. Under `Reciever`, choose the recieving COM port and baud rate and click `Connect`.
5. If needed, go to `Bitstream > Generate Bitstream` or change the state of any required bits under `Transmitter`.
6. Click on send and wait for the bits to be recieved by the `Reciever`.
